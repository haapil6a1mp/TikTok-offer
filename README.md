# TikTok

TikTok Premium API client. A reverse-engineered implementation of the **TikTok** (previously musical.ly) app's API.

# Usage

```python

import requests as r

class TikTokApiClient:

    protocol = "http"
    host = "localhost"
    port = 4444

    base_url = protocol + "://" + host + ":" + str(port)

    tok_proxy = ""
    api_token = ""

    def __init__(self, proxy, token) -> None:
        self.tok_proxy = proxy
        self.api_token = token

    def device_register(self):
        path = "/device-register"
        payload={}
        headers = {
            'tok-proxy': self.tok_proxy,
            'api-token': self.api_token
            }
        return r.post("GET", self.base_url + path, headers=headers, data=payload)

```
